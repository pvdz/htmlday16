# HTMLday 2016

This repo contains slides and experiments for my talk on iframes at htmlday 2016.

All these files can be found on github pages as well, just append whatever file to https://qfox.github.io/htmlday16/ since it won't give you a file listing.

Presentation can be found at https://qfox.github.io/htmlday16/htmlday2016.final.pdf

Video of the talk will be posted later.
